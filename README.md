## How it's Made

ExplorerX is a cutting-edge web3 application built with NextJS and Tailwind in the frontend, providing a modern and intuitive user interface that's both beautiful and functional. NextJS is a powerful React framework that makes building scalable and optimized web applications easy. Tailwind is a utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid prototyping and streamlined design. Together, NextJS and Tailwind create a responsive, user-friendly experience that's perfect for builders of all skill levels.

Behind the scenes, ExplorerX is powered by a suite of powerful technologies designed to make multi-chain smart contract management as easy and secure as possible. We use Polybase for secure and reliable storage of smart contract details entered by the user. Polybase is a decentralized, cloud-based storage solution that provides secure and scalable storage on the blockchain.

We also use Connext to deploy smart contracts on multiple chains. Connext is a layer 2 scaling solution that allows for fast and cheap transactions across multiple chains. By leveraging Connext, ExplorerX makes it easy to deploy smart contracts on multiple chains with just a few clicks.

Gnosis chain is another key technology we use in ExplorerX. Gnosis is a layer 2 scaling solution that provides fast and secure transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. With Gnosis chain, we're able to ensure that all smart contracts deployed through ExplorerX are secure and reliable.

Finally, we use the UMA protocol to verify manually added contracts, ensuring the utmost security for your smart contracts. The UMA protocol is a decentralized oracle solution that provides reliable and secure verification of smart contracts. By leveraging the UMA protocol, we're able to provide an added layer of security for all contracts deployed through ExplorerX.
